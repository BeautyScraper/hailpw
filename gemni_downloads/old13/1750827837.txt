A vibrant and alluring medium shot of a Sweaty wet voluptuous Indian Shiney skinned woman in her late 40s in a stylized, high-cut monokini or slingshot bikini that creates a deeply plunging neckline. The swimwear is made of a glossy, reflective dark blue or purple material, giving it a wet-look or metallic sheen. It features thin, delicate straps that outline the bust and wrap around the torso, creating a very revealing silhouette. She is also wearing a unique, form-fitting long glove on her left arm that extends past the elbow, in shades of purple and black with distinct yellow or gold accents, suggesting a tactical or fantasy-inspired design. Her dark hair is styled with subtle blue highlights, framing her face. Her makeup includes striking blue contact lenses that enhance her captivating gaze. She has a subtle, confident smile. On her right wrist, she wears a multi-strand pearl bracelet. The background is an interior setting with traditional Asian-inspired decor, including a dark wooden screen with subtle artwork, a bonsai tree, and soft, warm lighting from a lantern. The overall impression is a blend of modern allure and fantastical elegance, with a strong emphasis on the unique and revealing swimwear and glove.
