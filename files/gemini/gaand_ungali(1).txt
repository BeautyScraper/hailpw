A medium-shot, candid photograph taken from a slightly high angle, depicting a [milf] in what appears to be a school uniform, lying face down on a light grey sofa. She has dark hair and is wearing a white collared shirt, a grey and blue plaid skirt that is significantly pulled up, revealing white underwear, white socks, and dark school-style shoes. Her body is contorted, with her face pressed into the sofa cushion, and her mouth open, suggesting distress, pain, or unconsciousness. Her right hand is near her face.Behind her, partially visible on the right, is the head and upper torso of a person with dark hair, leaning in very close to her lower back and buttocks. Their face is blurred or obscured, and their hands are visible near her exposed buttocks, indicating an active, intimate interaction. The focus is on the woman's vulnerable position and her apparent state of distress. The lighting is soft and ambient, suggesting an indoor, possibly subdued, setting. The background is softly blurred, showing hints of a domestic environment. The prompt should capture the woman's helpless posture, her emotional state conveyed through her facial expression, and the implied non-consensual and intrusive interaction.
