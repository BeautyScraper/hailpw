A realistic, cinematic photograph of an Indian woman in her late 40s to early 50s, nude, squatting by a metal bucket, pouring water over herself from a small cup. Her skin is glistening with water, and her dark hair is wet and slicked back. She has a serene, contemplative, slightly weary expression, with her eyes cast downwards. Her body shows natural curves and signs of age, depicted respectfully and without idealization. The setting is a dimly lit, rustic interior with rough, weathered walls. In the background, partially obscured by a window frame, a young boy's face is subtly visible, looking in. The lighting is soft and natural, highlighting the textures of her skin and the water, with a slightly desaturated color palette to enhance the realism and somber mood. The composition should be a medium shot, focusing on the woman, with enough of the environment visible to establish the context.
