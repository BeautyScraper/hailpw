[[image],||] A [milf] with [hairstyle] and wide  eyes kneels on the rocky ground. [She wears a simple, tattered white dress that reveals a voluptuous figure || [whore]]. Her hands are bound above her head by thick chains to a rough-hewn stone pillar. Her expression is a mix of fear and vulnerability, with her mouth slightly agape as if she's catching her breath. Beside her, a menacing, scaly dragon with an orange and red body and large leathery wings rears its head back, its mouth wide open in a fierce roar. The dragon's eyes are a vibrant orange, matching its body. The scene is set in a rocky, desolate landscape under a dramatic, cloudy sky with hints of orange and red, suggesting a sunset or a looming conflict. composition emphasizes the contrast between the powerful, monstrous creature and the delicate, helpless woman.
