A voluptuous sweaty  Indian woman with glistening skin in her late 30s or early 40s revealing   huge cleavage. with pulled back hair with loose strands around her face, she is adorned in elaborate gold jewelry including a detailed necklace, bracelets, and headpiece with sun-like elements, she is having weapons in her hand. She wears a heavily embellished, revealing Gold costume made with thorns and chains that appears to be part of a traditional or fantasy setting. her overall style should evoke a sense of ancient royalty or a powerful mythological figure.. Her hands are on her chest, and her expression shows a mix of fear and discomfort. She is surrounded by four Indian frail men in their late teens or early twenties  with short height.

Two men are positioned on either side of her, their hands on her arms and shoulders, restraining or holding her. One man behind her has his hands on her back, while another in front is reaching towards her. The men are wearing white t-shirts. The setting is indoors, with a subtle background suggesting a traditional [Japanese||Indian] room with some decor, possibly a scroll on the wall. The lighting is soft but clear, emphasizing the figures and their interaction. The overall mood is one of unease and a power imbalance.
