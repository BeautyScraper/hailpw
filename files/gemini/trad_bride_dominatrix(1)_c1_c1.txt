The woman's right knee is pressing into the man's back, and she is holding onto a leash or strap attached to his harness.The environment is a dark room with concrete floors and grey walls. In the background, there is a large, black metal cage, a wooden table with several lit black candles on it, a single bed with black bedding, and an old-fashioned lantern hanging from the ceiling. The lighting is dramatic, with a warm, reddish glow from the candles casting long shadows across the room. The overall mood is intense and theatrical.
