A [tilf] with long, dark hair, [whore], is seated on a low stool or the floor. Her hands are cuffed together in front of her. She looks upward with a wide-eyed, slightly agape mouth, conveying a mix of shock, fear, and apprehension. Her posture is somewhat slumped, suggesting vulnerability or resignation.

Leaning over her from the right is another, [milf] with dark, wavy hair, [wore]. She holds a gold police or detective badge near the first woman's face, displaying it prominently. Her expression is stern and commanding, with a slight smirk or look of authority. Her body language is dominant and interrogative, with one hand resting on the table for support as she leans in closely to the seated woman.

The setting is an indoor room with large windows in the background that show diffused natural light and hints of green foliage outside. A rustic wooden table with a dark metal frame is between the two women. The overall lighting is soft but highlights the figures. The scene should evoke a sense of tension, power imbalance, and a serious, possibly interrogative, situation.
