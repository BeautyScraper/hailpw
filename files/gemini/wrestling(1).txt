She is held aloft by two men; one man with dark hair is holding her waist from the front, looking up at her with a mix of aggression and desire. The other man with tattoos on his arms is gripping her legs from behind, his head lowered as if in a power stance. A third man with long, light brown hair and a muscular physique is positioned behind the woman, standing on the ropes of the ring.
