she is dressed in a traditional Japanese-inspired outfit with a modern, revealing twist. She wears a flowing, layered kimono-style robe, primarily white with striking red accents and black trim. The robe features wide, oversized sleeves that drape elegantly, revealing toned arms. The main body of the robe is cinched at the waist with a dark, possibly black or deep red, obi-style belt, highlighting her athletic build.

The intricate details include subtle patterns on the white fabric, possibly a faint geometric design or a stylized emblem, particularly visible on the lower half of the robe. Red circular or crescent moon-shaped motifs are prominently displayed on the front panels of the robe, one on each side, adding a spiritual or symbolic element. The inner lining of the sleeves and possibly the collar appears to be a contrasting red.

Her lower body is adorned with what appears to be a split skirt or hakama-like garment, allowing for maximum mobility, revealing strong, muscular thighs. This lower garment also maintains the white, red, and black color scheme. She wears dark, form-fitting leg wraps or tabi-style socks that extend up her calves, paired with traditional Japanese sandals (zori or geta style) with dark straps.
