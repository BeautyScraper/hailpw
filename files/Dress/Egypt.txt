she is adorned in an elaborate, highly detailed golden costume. Her headpiece is a prominent, ornate golden Uraeus crown, featuring a cobra motif at the front, intricately textured with fine scales and shimmering gold. Her neck is encircled by a wide, multi-layered golden collar, possibly an Usekh collar, embedded with striking blue and black inlays or gemstones, showcasing meticulous geometric patterns.

Her upper body is covered by a golden 'bra' or breastplate, formed from multiple, overlapping, highly polished golden plates that conform to her figure, reflecting light intensely. The edges of these plates should appear expertly crafted, with a seamless, almost liquid-gold aesthetic.

Around her hips, she wears a minimalist yet elegant golden G-string or loincloth, which transitions into a multi-tiered, pleated golden apron or panel, hanging down the front. This apron should have sharp, defined pleats and a rich, metallic sheen, giving it a regal and substantial appearance.

Her forearms are adorned with wide, multiple-banded golden armlets or cuffs, meticulously sculpted with intricate engravings or embossed patterns, hinting at ancient Egyptian artistry. Each band should be distinct and reflect light beautifully. The overall impression of the dress is one of immense wealth, divine status, and masterful craftsmanship, with every golden element appearing exceptionally refined and radiant under a warm, golden light.
