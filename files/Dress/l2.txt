The Dress/Outfit: The most prominent feature is a highly detailed, two-piece ensemble.

    Top: A white, off-the-shoulder, short-sleeved blouse with puffed shoulders and a ruffled or gathered trim around the neckline. This blouse is cropped, revealing the midriff and décolletage.

    Bottom/Bodysuit: A glossy black, form-fitting, high-cut bodysuit or leotard made of a material that resembles patent leather or latex, with a wet look finish. This piece features intricate strap detailing across the chest and stomach, possibly with silver or metallic hardware like buckles, O-rings, or studs. There are suspender-like straps extending upwards from the bodysuit, attaching to the white top or appearing as part of a harness design over the shoulders. The high-cut leg openings dramatically emphasize the hips and upper thighs.

    Accessories:

        Gloves: Long, sleek black gloves or gauntlets extending past the elbows, made of a similar glossy material as the bodysuit, possibly with silver accents.

        Thigh-High Boots/Stockings: Glossy black, thigh-high boots or separate leg coverings that reach well above the knee, also with a patent leather or latex look. These appear to have a structured, fitted design, possibly with straps or bands around the upper thigh.

        Fishnet Stockings: Visible under the thigh-high boots, a layer of black fishnet or patterned stockings, adding textural contrast.

        Headwear: A black, military-style cap or peaked cap, possibly with a subtle metallic emblem or detail on the front.

        Weapon/Prop: She holds a sleek, futuristic-looking staff, spear, or rifle, predominantly black with metallic accents and glowing elements (e.g., a blue or purple light emanating from parts of the prop).
