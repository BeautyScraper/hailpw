She wears a striking, multi-layered outfit that blends military and formal elements with a dark fantasy aesthetic.

Upper Body & Coat:
Her most prominent garment is a wide, flowing, structured coat or cape in shades of dark charcoal, black, and off-white. The shoulders are broad and highly embellished, featuring large, metallic gold epaulets with intricate raised designs and long, flowing tassels or fringes in white and dark grey. The collar is high and stiff, with an elaborate, almost ruffled or pleated white inner lining that extends down the front. The main body of the coat has sharp, angular panels and subtle geometric patterns in varying shades of dark grey and black, possibly resembling scales or armored plating. The sleeves are wide and open, resembling large, bell-shaped extensions, revealing her arms. There are subtle golden accents and perhaps small, decorative buttons or clasps on the front of the coat.

Torso & Inner Wear:
Beneath the coat, her torso is clad in a revealing, almost bandage-like or strap-based garment in a light, possibly off-white or very pale tan color. This inner wear crisscrosses her midriff, leaving portions of her abdomen exposed, and features a distinctive, almost skeletal or rib-like pattern across her chest, possibly outlined in a darker shade or with subtle metallic glints. There's a small, circular emblem with a 'devil' symbol on her right hip.

Lower Body:
She wears tight, dark, form-fitting trousers or leggings that appear to be made of leather or a similar material. These trousers have distressed or ripped sections, particularly around the knees and thighs, revealing glimpses of skin underneath. The lower legs are smooth and sleek, leading down to her footwear.

Footwear:
Her shoes are elegant, high-heeled pumps or closed-toe heels in a dark color, possibly black, with a contrasting lighter sole or accent. Delicate, almost chain-like or metallic anklets adorn her ankles.

Accessories & Overall Silhouette:
Prominently featured are two large, horn-like or wing-like structures rising vertically from her back, matching the color and texture of her coat's epaulets, with a slightly iridescent or metallic sheen. She has small, pointed horns protruding from her forehead. A long, thin, segmented tail, similar to a devil's tail, extends from her lower back, ending in a sharp, spade-like tip, subtly wrapping around her leg. The overall silhouette is sharp, angular, and imposing, with a strong emphasis on structured shoulders and flowing drapery.
