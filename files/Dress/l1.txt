She is wearing an exquisitely detailed light blue or pale mint green lingerie set. The set consists of a push-up bra and matching bikini-style briefs, overlaid with a sheer, flowing babydoll or chemise.

Focus on the intricacies of the dress/lingerie:

    Bra: The bra features delicate lace overlays, possibly a floral or leaf pattern, especially on the cups. There are subtle ruched or gathered details on the outer edges of the cups, and a central tie-front detail with thin, silken ties, possibly ending in small decorative elements like beads or tassels. The straps are thin and adjustable.

    Briefs: The matching briefs have lace detailing along the waistline and leg openings, echoing the pattern on the bra. They are designed to sit just below the navel, highlighting the figure.

    Babydoll/Chemise: The sheer overlay piece is made of a soft, lightweight fabric like chiffon or delicate mesh. It drapes gracefully over her body, opening at the front to reveal the lingerie underneath. The edges of the chemise are subtly finished, perhaps with a narrow rolled hem or a delicate lace trim that is almost invisible. The cut is flowing and loose-fitting, enhancing the softness of the image. The color is a consistent light blue/mint throughout the entire set, possibly with a slight sheen from the fabric.
