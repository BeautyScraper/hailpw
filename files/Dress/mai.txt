she is wearing A striking, highly detailed rendering of Mai Shiranui's classic outfit. The central piece is a vibrant, fire-engine red, sleeveless mini-dress or kimono-style tunic with a deep, plunging V-neckline that extends almost to the navel. The neckline and armholes are trimmed with a crisp white border, providing a sharp contrast.

The dress features extremely high, scalloped or curved slits on both sides, extending up past the hip to fully expose the upper thighs and hips. These slits are also edged with the same white trim, enhancing the fluidity and boldness of the design.

Around the waist, a wide, dark indigo or black obi (sash) is cinched tightly, creating an hourglass silhouette. This obi is smooth and without elaborate patterns, serving as a grounding element for the vibrant red.

A prominent feature is the large, white, flowing piece of fabric, reminiscent of a long, wide sash or an elongated tassel, draped over the back and extending downwards, ending in a large, spherical, red pompom or weighted ball. This element has a dynamic, almost cloud-like quality, suggesting movement.

On her forearms, she wears dark, fitted armbands or fingerless gloves that extend up to just below the elbow. Her lower legs are adorned with dark ankle wraps or soft, sock-like coverings, possibly in the same indigo/black as the obi, with thin red ties or straps securing them. Her footwear consists of simple, open-toed sandals or thongs, also in red, with minimal strapping.
