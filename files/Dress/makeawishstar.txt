she is wearing a highly detailed, custom-fit, jet-black high-gloss PVC or wet-look latex harness-style bodysuit. The material appears to have a slight sheen, reflecting light.

Upper Body/Chest:
The top portion is a true harness construction, not just decorative straps. It features thin, precise straps, approximately 1-1.5 cm in width, forming an elaborate geometric pattern. These straps originate from a wide, structured choker collar (around 4-5 cm wide) with a prominent, highly polished silver O-ring centered at the front, acting as a focal point. From this O-ring, multiple straps branch out:

    Two straps extend downwards and outwards, creating triangular cutouts over the upper chest/décolletage, converging just below the sternum.

    Additional straps run vertically, outlining the inner edge of her breasts, leading down to connect with the lower harness section.

    There are minimalist triangular cups formed by these straps, which are themselves outlined with the same thin black material, offering a "cupless" or "peek-a-boo" effect.

    A delicate, thin silver chain drapes from the center of the choker's O-ring, cascading down her sternum, ending just above the navel. This chain is composed of small, uniform links.

Mid-section/Torso:
The bodysuit seamlessly transitions into a high-cut thong or Brazilian-style bottom, designed to accentuate the hip line and elongate the legs. The material stretches taut across her torso, emphasizing her hourglass figure. There are no seams or bulky closures visible from the front.

Lower Body/Legs & Heels:

    The harness design continues onto the upper thighs, with thin straps encircling them like thigh garters. These thigh straps also feature smaller, strategically placed silver O-rings as connection points for additional dangling elements.

    From these thigh O-rings, multiple strands of delicate silver chain cascade downwards, wrapping loosely around her legs. These chains are not uniform; some appear slightly longer, creating a staggered effect.

    She is wearing extremely high, platform stiletto heels made of the same shiny black material, possibly with clear or black transparent elements on the straps. The ankle straps of the heels are also adorned with similar delicate silver chains that drape around the ankle and potentially over the top of the foot, connecting back to the shoe's structure, mimicking the chains on the bodysuit itself.
